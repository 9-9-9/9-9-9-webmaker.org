        Welcome to Webmaker &mdash; a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla</a>
        project dedicated to helping you create something amazing on the <a href="/">web</a>.
        Our <a href="/tools">tools</a>, <a href="/events">events</a> and <a href="/teach">learning guides</a>
        allow webmakers to not only create the content that makes the web great, but &mdash; perhaps more
        importantly &mdash; understand how the web works. With this knowledge, we can make a web without limits.
        That's the philosophy behind webmaker.org. We've built everything so you can remix it. Enjoy!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Our goal:</strong> encourage millions of people around the world to move beyond using the web
      to making it.</p>

        <p>
          Creating the web is the heart of our work. We build tools like <a href="//thimble.webmaker.org">Thimble</a>
          and <a href="//popcorn.webmaker.org">Popcorn Maker</a> that allow people to create amazing content while
          peeking under the hood of the internet, getting familiar with all the moving parts and getting their hands
          dirty by creating, hacking and remixing parts of the web with
          foundational elements like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        <h3><a href="/teach">Teach &amp; Learning</a></h3>
        <p>
          Learning through making is a core part of Mozilla's mission and we provide starter projects,
          <a href="/t/template">templates</a> and <a href="/teach">how-to guides</a> to inspire teachers and learners
          at every level to create on the web and share their knowledge with others. We consider
          <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracies">digital literacy</a> a critical skill just like reading, writing and math.
          After all, it's only when we understand the building blocks of the web that we can have a hand in shaping its future.

        <h3><a href="/getinvolved">Community</a></h3>
        <p>
        We recognize that innovation can come from anyone, anywhere so we bring together people with diverse skills and backgrounds &mdash;
        teachers, filmmakers, <a href="http://www.mozillaopennews.org/">journalists</a>, hackers,
        youth, artists, <a href="http://kaythaney.com/">scientists</a> policy-makers and more  &mdash;  to collaborate online and at
        events around the globe.
